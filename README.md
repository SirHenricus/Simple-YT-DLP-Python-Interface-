# Simple YT-DLP Python Interface

A little Yt-dlp python interface that I made. Some parts of the code were written with ChatGPT. The code has not been tested very well so please expect some issues.

Make sure when downloading this code to create an empty folder called 'output' in the same directory that the python file is located.

There is a chance that you will need ffmpeg for this code.
